You run your hand along one of the panels...and scratch yourself on a bur. Piece of junk... 
You can feel the gaps in the panels and dents from handling as you walk around the room. 
You feel the small divets - meant to make the room feel more natural - pushing against the soles of your feet as you walk.
The floor feels natural and comfortable to walk on, like soft earth.
You feel at ease, the wall panels seamless and the floor ergonomic and responsive to your touch.
