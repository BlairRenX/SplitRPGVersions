You hear the arrhythmic throb of machinery all around you. It's a little disconcerting. 
You hear the door hum and click as you enter, but the room is otherwise silent.
Other than occasional beeps from signal equipment, the room is almost eerily silent. 
Quiet music begins to play from a hidden speaker as you enter the room. 
Ambient noise personalised to your tastes begins to emanate from the room.
