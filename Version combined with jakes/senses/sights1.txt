The walls of the room have clearly been scavenged, the corners rusting and the panels ill-fitting.
The room is a cheab pre-fab job, bland and disinteresting while still functional. 
It's a pre-fab room of middling quality. The panels look about 30 years old, give or take. 
You can't tell if the room's pre-fab or not, the modern-looking panels connected seamlessly. 
The panels in the room adjust to a pleasing texture. This room's definitely a custom job, and an expensive one at that.
